# Manuvo

**Real-time ASL recognition, gesture interpretation, and accessibility intelligence.**

Manuvo is a modular AI-powered platform that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) in real-time, provides feedback for learners, and enables accessible communication across personal, educational, and emergency contexts.  
Its core engine is built for **image recognition, AWS Lambda serverless processing, responsive web/mobile layouts, mobile/iOS support, and real-time feedback**, with extensions for creative spin-off applications.

## 🚀 Core Features
- **ASL Gesture Recognition**  
  - Uses computer vision (OpenCV / TensorFlow / PyTorch) to recognize hand gestures in real-time.  
  - Provides visual feedback for learners to improve accuracy.  
- **Serverless Processing**  
  - AWS Lambda functions handle image processing and prediction at scale.  
- **Responsive Web & Mobile/iOS Layouts**  
  - Built with React + TailwindCSS for desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
  - Optional React Native app for iOS and Android with live gesture recognition.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**  
  - Instant translation from gestures to text/speech, optimized for mobile/iOS.

### 2. **Gesture-Controlled Smart Home Assistant**
- **Problem:** People with limited mobility often struggle with physical controls in their environment.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Repurpose the ASL recognition backend for touch-free control of lights, doors, appliances, and smart devices.  
  - Customizable gesture mappings for personalized accessibility, including mobile/iOS interface for control.  
- **Tech:**  
  - Edge device integration (Raspberry Pi / IoT hubs).  
  - Secure API calls to smart home systems (Philips Hue, HomeKit, etc.).  
  - Gesture training dashboard for personal adaptation.

### 3. **Emergency Accessibility Translator**
- **Problem:** Hospitals and emergency rooms need instant communication for ASL users in urgent situations.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Mobile app that instantly translates between ASL, spoken English, and text, optimized for iOS devices.  
  - Ensures clear, rapid communication during emergencies.  
- **Tech:**  
  - Mobile-optimized camera + lightweight CV models.  
  - Offline translation support for critical scenarios.  
  - HIPAA-compliant handling of sensitive data.

## 📈 Example Use Cases
- An ASL learner practices with real-time web and mobile/iOS feedback to improve gesture accuracy.
- A classroom integrates the multilingual tutor, allowing students and teachers to communicate seamlessly across devices.
- A smart home user controls lights and appliances hands-free via gestures from mobile/iOS or desktop.
- Hospital staff uses the emergency translator on iOS devices to communicate with a deaf patient instantly.

## ✅ Next Steps
- Implement core ASL recognition pipeline for web and mobile/iOS
- Connect AWS Lambda functions for scalable gesture processing
- Build responsive web interface with live feedback
- Build React Native mobile/iOS app with real-time camera feed
- Expand into spin-off applications (multilingual tutor, smart home, emergency translator)

## 🔮 Vision
Manuvo is not just about gesture recognition — it’s about bridging communication gaps, empowering accessibility, and creating real-time, human-centered solutions across web and mobile platforms.
